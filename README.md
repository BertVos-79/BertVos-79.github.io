# BertVos-79.github.io

Welcome to the repository for my personal website, which showcases my curriculum vitae and some of my professional projects. This repository contains all the files needed for the website's functionality and design.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

### Files and Folders

- **index.html**: The main landing page of the website. It includes a brief introduction about me, links to other pages, and highlights of my featured projects.
  
- **about.html**: A detailed "About Me" page that provides an overview of my skills, professional experience, and contact information.

- **blog.html**: A page showcasing some of my featured projects, including descriptions and visual elements. Each project is linked to additional details.

- **images/**: A folder containing all the images used on the website, such as:
  - `head_shot.jpeg`: A personal photo for the website's header.
  - `brainjar.png`: An image used for the first project related to STEM education.
  - `kr8cht.png`: An image for the second project involving IMECâ€™s ITEC Division.
  - `kbr.png`: An image for the third project about LabEL at the Royal Library of Belgium.

### Additional Files
