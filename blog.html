            <h2>Unifying Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs for STEM Education</h2>
            <p>As a history teacher, I always dreamed of tools that could help create lesson material effortlessly. 
               Imagine brainstorming with a chatbot that suggests ideas, graphs, and exercises! This blog dives into how unifying Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs could do just that. 
               STEM education often involves complex interdisciplinary challenges, and teachers frequently struggle to design projects merging various disciplines. By combining the generative power of LLMs 
               with the structured accuracy of Knowledge Graphs, we can provide teachers with a support system that aligns with educational standards while sparking creativity in lesson planning. 
               It's an exciting area of exploration that could revolutionize how we teach and learn!</p>

            <h2>Excited to Join IMEC’s ITEC Division for Smart Education</h2>
            <p>After several applications, I am beyond excited to announce that I’ll be joining IMEC’s renowned ITEC division for my master's internship! 
               I’ll be contributing to their fascinating project Kr8cht, an educational game designed to help children discover their interests and potential career paths. 
               I still remember walking around the iconic Mons des Arts in Brussels, with its incredible museums like the Magritte Museum and Bozar. The Royal Library sits right there, housing treasures of knowledge—and now, 
               I’m thrilled to be collaborating on a cutting-edge educational tool right in the heart of this cultural hub. This project combines my love for education and AI in the best way possible!</p>

            <h2>Exploring Digital Literature with LabEL at the Royal Library of Belgium</h2>
            <p>As a volunteer at the Laboratory for Electronic Literature (LabEL), I’ve embarked on a fascinating journey into the world of digital-born literary works. 
               These include interactive fiction powered by AI, self-erasing poems, and much more. Working at the Royal Library (KBR) feels like uncovering hidden treasures—did you know there’s even a stunning terrace offering breathtaking views of medieval Brussels? 
               LabEL’s mission is vital: archiving and preserving this vulnerable form of literature, often lost to technological obsolescence. For me, this project is a beautiful convergence of technology, creativity, 
               and cultural heritage, and I’m proud to contribute to preserving Belgium’s literary innovations for future generations.</p>
